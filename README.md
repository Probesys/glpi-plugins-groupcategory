GLPI groupCategory Plugin
=========================

By Probesys: https://probesys.com

Language: french

Works with: GLPI 9.5.X ( tested with 9.5.1 )

This plugin customizes the list of accessible ticket categories for ticket requesters.

Features
========

* configure list of allowed/disallowed categories for every group. Go to Administration -> Groups -> select a group -> scroll down. Example: group XYZ can have category ABC, but group UVW won't.
* change the list of available categories on the ticket creation form. Example: If the requester of a ticket is in group XYZ, the categories will include ABC. If the requester is in group UVW, category ABC won't be available.
* if a group's allowed categories list is empty, requesters in this group will have access to nearly all categories (depending on entities and if the categories are recursive)

Known issues
============

* none yet

Possible evolutions
===================

* Add category configuration through massive actions on groups
* The same feature could be applied for entities. If you have a lot of categories it would be easier to make them accessible to entities instead of recreating them one by one.
